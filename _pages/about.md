I was born in Nepal, but mostly grew up In the United States. I speak both English and Nepali, but with Nepali put heavy emphasis on “speak”.


With all the creative passions I have, I like to consider myself as belonging within the camp of “jack of all trades, master of none”. Generally, I hope to use this space as an archive for all the different things I do.  


My art and world view is very much influenced by my politics (this could also work vice versa). Politically I view myself as not necessarily having labels, but I believe in the dignity & equality of all.
